Well this was supposed to include all the files for my game made in GameMaker but my GitHub didn't sync the files as I worked on it
I couldn't upload all the files as there were too many, and Github only allows for 100 files at a time to be uplaoded (theres about 4000 files)
So I uploaded the Sprites that I made (+ ones from a tutorial I initially used) and the game itself on itch.io
This game was created as part of training for the Hack Club Campfire in Mississauga 2026!
The theme for the game is "Stuck In A Loop," hope you enjoy!
