Well this was supposed to include all the files for my game made in GameMaker but my GitHub didn't sync the files as I worked oon it
I couldn't upload all the files as there were too many, and Github only allows for 100 files at a time to be uplaoded (theres about 4000 files)
So I uploaded the Sprites that I made (+ ones from a tutorial I initially used) and the game itself on itch.io
The theme for the game is "Stuck In A Loop," hope you enjoy!
